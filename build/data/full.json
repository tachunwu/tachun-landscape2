As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages."},{"category":"Materials","homepage_url":"https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/","id":"materials--courses--rl-course-by-david-silver","logo":"logos/9ccbc9dc50fa7d14003a8f9b45ed4b8280dbeebda357b9b0b323fa913d7a2717.svg","name":"RL Course by David Silver","subcategory":"Courses","description":"Reinforcement Learning by David Silver","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind"},{"category":"Materials","homepage_url":"https://github.com/risinglightdb/risinglight","id":"materials--courses--risinglight","logo":"logos/d47395b4dd646a77cb80292d47f24c49ca89a6404665cd43300d53424422acbc.svg","name":"RisingLight","subcategory":"Courses","description":"An educational OLAP database system","repositories":[{"url":"https://github.com/risinglightdb/risinglight","primary":true}]},{"category":"Materials","homepage_url":"https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb","id":"materials--courses--toydb","logo":"logos/47c082c9463c3ba1ed7ef8daf97d3e509be324f8d9a398b8230e3d1cc1a027ec.svg","name":"ToyDB","subcategory":"Courses","description":"Distributed SQL database in Rust, written as a learning project","repositories":[{"url":"https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb","primary":true}]},{"category":"Research","homepage_url":"https://cncf.io","id":"research--distributed-systems--tao","logo":"logos/0b22fe6553ffd6c927de0a316a0b01cde01e4c3932170c13bfebb45153f0cdb8.svg","name":"TAO","subcategory":"Distributed Systems","crunchbase_url":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloud-native-computing-foundation","description":"This is the description of item 6","repositories":[{"url":"https://github.com/cncf/landscape2","primary":true}],"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/CloudNativeFdn"},{"category":"Research","homepage_url":"https://cncf.io","id":"research--databases--calvin","logo":"logos/0b22fe6553ffd6c927de0a316a0b01cde01e4c3932170c13bfebb45153f0cdb8.svg","name":"Calvin","subcategory":"Databases","crunchbase_url":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloud-native-computing-foundation","description":"This is the description of item 9","repositories":[{"url":"https://github.com/cncf/landscape2","primary":true}],"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/CloudNativeFdn"},{"category":"Taste","homepage_url":"https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs","id":"taste--ml--haystack","logo":"logos/317dd67e25c4e3e20cd28ccf32308c7fac34107ad3b2401be8e765a17229873f.svg","name":"Haystack","subcategory":"ML","description":"üîç LLM orchestration framework to build customizable, production-ready LLM applications.
